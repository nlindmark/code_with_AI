# Nordic Snowflake Lab

## Overview

Journey through a Swedish research station studying snowflake patterns and symmetry in the Arctic winter. Learn to analyze crystallographic structures, process sensor data, and predict formation patterns using atmospheric conditions.

## Story

You've joined the Nordic Snowflake Research Lab in Kiruna, Sweden, one of Europe's northernmost scientific stations located at 67.8558°N. The lab studies how atmospheric conditions affect snowflake formation and symmetry patterns. Your task is to help the research team analyze snowflake structures, correlate them with weather data, and build predictive models for crystal formation.

Each level takes you deeper into the fascinating world of ice crystal mathematics and real-world data science. From basic symmetry detection to complex IoT sensor analysis, you'll apply programming skills to solve authentic research challenges faced by Arctic climate scientists.

## Context

This competition uses authentic Nordic research station data patterns and locations. Kiruna, Sweden (67.8558°N, 20.2253°E, 530m altitude) is home to real atmospheric research facilities including the Swedish Institute of Space Physics and EISCAT radar systems. 

The temperature ranges (-11°C to -22°C) reflect typical Arctic winter conditions. The sensor network structure and data formats mirror actual IoT deployments used in climate research across Scandinavia. The complexity scoring system is inspired by real crystallographic classification methods used in snow science.

## Estimated Time

**Total**: 45-60 minutes

- Levels 1-2: 15 minutes (fundamentals and pattern recognition)
- Level 3: 15 minutes (algorithm development and testing)
- Levels 4-5: 25 minutes (advanced data parsing and analysis)

Participants with strong Python experience may complete faster, while those new to data science concepts should allow the full hour.
