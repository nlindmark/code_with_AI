  "description": "The lab director wants to classify snowflakes by their complexity!\n\nA snowflake's complexity score is calculated as:\n- Count how many different character types appear in the pattern\n- Multiply by the length of the pattern (6 for all snowflakes)\n- Then divide by the number of times the most common character appears\n- Round down to nearest integer\n\nFor example:\n- '******' → 1 type × 6 / 6 = 1\n- '*+*+*+' → 2 types × 6 / 3 = 4\n- '*++*++' → 2 types × 6 / 4 = 3\n\nCalculate the complexity score for: {{input}}",
