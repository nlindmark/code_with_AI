Thanks to VBG's advanced coupling lock and angle monitoring system, the trailer remained securely attached, preventing a catastrophic multi-vehicle collision. However, the incident triggered multiple safety alarms.\n\nYou've been assigned as the lead forensic analyst to investigate the CAN bus data log recovered from the vehicle's BCM (Body Control Module), CSM (Coupling Safety Module), and DSM (Drawbar Stability Module).\n\nYour task begins with a basic analysis:\n\n**Using the attached CAN log file ({{input}}), determine how many TOTAL CAN messages were recorded during this incident.**\n\nThis will establish the scope of data we're working with.",
