  "description": "**FORENSIC TIMELINE RECONSTRUCTION - DAY 4**\n**Lead Investigator**: Systems Safety Analysis Team\n**Objective**: Establish causal relationship\n\nExcellent detective work finding those 93 undefined sensor readings. Now we need to establish the timeline to determine if the coupling sensor anomaly **caused** or **resulted from** the jack-knifing event.\n\nWe need to compare two critical timestamps:\n\n1. **First Coupling Anomaly**: When did 0xCF06523 (DBLLCKSNSR) first report value 0x03?\n2. **Jack-Knifing Activation**: When did 0xCF07731 (JCKKNFNGSTS) first show non-zero data?\n\nThe time format in the log is: `HH:MM:SS:MSMS` (hours:minutes:seconds:milliseconds)\n\n**Your task: What was the time difference (in milliseconds) between:**\n- The FIRST occurrence of coupling sensor \"Undefined\" status (0x03), and\n- The FIRST occurrence of jack-knifing detection activation (non-zero data)\n\n**Enter the time difference in milliseconds. If the coupling sensor anomaly came first, enter a positive number. If jack-knifing came first, enter a negative number.**\n\n*Formula: (Jack-knifing timestamp) - (Coupling anomaly timestamp) in milliseconds*\n\nExample: If coupling anomaly was at 11:40:03:1406 and jack-knifing at 11:40:04:1372, the difference would be approximately 1000ms (1 second).\n\n*Using the same CAN log file.*",

  "hint": "Find the first message with 0xCF06523 containing 0x03, note its timestamp. Then find the first 0xCF07731 with non-zero data. Convert both timestamps to milliseconds and subtract. Format is HH:MM:SS:MSMS where the last 4 digits are milliseconds (e.g., 11:40:03:1406 = 1406ms in that second)."
