  "description": "**FINAL INCIDENT REPORT - DAY 5**\n**Classification**: Safety Critical - System Design Review Required\n**Distribution**: VBG Engineering, Quality Assurance, Safety Board\n\nYour investigation has revealed a critical chain of events:\n\n**Timeline Established:**\n1. At 11:40:03, VBG coupling sensors began reporting \"Undefined\" (0x03) status\n2. 966 milliseconds later, jack-knifing detection activated\n3. Multiple safety systems engaged simultaneously\n\nThe VBG TE (Trailer Eyes) system has TWO redundant coupling sensors:\n- **CSM Sensor** (0xCF06523): DBLLCKSNSR - Trailer-side coupling lock sensor\n- **BCM/DSM Sensor** (0xCF06931): DBLLCKSNSRTRCK - Truck-side coupling sensor\n\nIn a properly functioning system, if one sensor fails, the other should maintain reliable readings. However, during this incident, BOTH sensors reported the same anomalous \"Undefined\" state.\n\n**Your final task: Calculate the TOTAL number of \"Undefined\" (0x03) status messages across BOTH coupling sensors combined.**\n\nThis will determine the severity and duration of the sensor failure that preceded the jack-knifing event.\n\n**VBG SAFETY NOTE**: This investigation has identified a potential design vulnerability where extreme lateral forces during emergency maneuvers can cause simultaneous sensor disturbances. The jack-knifing detection system functioned correctly and prevented trailer separation, but the coupling sensor redundancy design requires review.\n\n*Your analysis will inform critical safety improvements to VBG's next-generation coupling systems.*\n\n*Using the same CAN log file.*",
