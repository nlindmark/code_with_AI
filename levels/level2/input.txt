There are 42 apples in the basket. We found -5 rotten ones, so we removed them.
The remaining 37 apples are good quality.
Later, we added 15 more apples from another batch.
Now we have 52 total apples.
But wait, 8 apples were eaten, leaving us with 44.
We sold 12 of them for 3 dollars each, making 36 dollars profit.
The final count is 32 apples remaining in storage.
Earlier today, there were -3 damaged apples that we discarded.
Total apples processed: 29 + 15 - 8 + 12 - 3 = 45.
